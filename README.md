# Brianna
Project Brianna aims to assist creating work shift schedules across multiple workstations in a simple and intuitive way. 
The system is comprised of a basic “home page” for workers to view the current work rota and submit their schedule preference for the next schedule, and a dynamic portal for the shift setter to easily build a work rota that works best for everyone.
In addition, there are also options for shift managers to send logistical and obedience reports per shift.
The goal of this project is to cut down on workload for the rota setter by quickening the procedure of creating a fair schedule from days to seconds.
